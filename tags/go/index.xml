      <description>I recently migrated one of the go lang projects that i contribute to which is csvdiff from glide to dep. Here is what i had to do.
âžœ csvdiff git:(glide-to-dep-migration) dep init Importing configuration from glide. These are only initial constraints, and are further refined during the solve process. Detected glide configuration files... Converting from glide.yaml and glide.lock... Using ^1.0.0 as initial constraint for imported dep github.com/cespare/xxhash Trying v1.0.0 (5c37fe3) as initial lock for imported dep github.</description>
