It was so frustrating for me to connect my printer(HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 2700 All-In-One printer) to print over wifi network and the most calming part in this frustrating experience is the slogan that is stamped on the printer! "Keep it simple" ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

It is definitely not simple unless you know the trick ðŸ˜Š

Hence i am writing this blog for my future self and also people who face the same issue.

## Instructions for a successful setup over Wi-Fi(using mobile app)

1. Ensure your mobile is connected to a Wi-Fi.
2. Install both HP smart and HP print service plugin mobile apps. If you are facing difficulties in finding these apps kindly visit https://123.hp.com
3. The most important secret is this, On the printer hold the Wireless button and cancel button for 3 seconds. The power button will blink for a few seconds, and the printer will be in setup mode(The wireless button will continue to blink until the printer is connected to the Wi-Fi network.)

4. Once this is done, add your printer as a new printer, in your mobile app and follow the steps in the apps. These steps apply even if you are changing from one wireless network to another. (Follow left to right in the image below)
