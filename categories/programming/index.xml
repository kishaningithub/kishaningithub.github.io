      <description>I recently migrated one of the go lang projects that i contribute to which is csvdiff from glide to dep. Here is what i had to do.&#xA;➜ csvdiff git:(glide-to-dep-migration) dep init Importing configuration from glide. These are only initial constraints, and are further refined during the solve process. Detected glide configuration files... Converting from glide.yaml and glide.lock... Using ^1.0.0 as initial constraint for imported dep github.com/cespare/xxhash Trying v1.0.0 (5c37fe3) as initial lock for imported dep github.</description>

      <description>fn main() { let chinese_text = &amp;#34;可通過每頁左上角的連結隨時調整&amp;#34;; let chinese_text_slice = &amp;amp;chinese_text[0..1]; // Focus here println!(&amp;#34;{}&amp;#34;, chinese_text_slice); } In the above code i want to extract the first character out which is 可. Since the end indices are exclusive in rust i put forth a slice 0..1 on chinese_text.&#xA;If you expected the output to be 可. You are in for a surprise!&#xA;break_strings$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.</description>
